## Motivation

Xonsh is a Python-based shell, and to run xonsh you must have Python installed. The Python version and its packages can be installed and located anywhere: in the operating system directories, as part of a virtual environment, as part of the user directory, or as a virtual drive created temporarily behind the scenes by the Linux AppImage. When you execute `import` or any other Python code during a xonsh session, it will be executed in the Python environment that was used to run the current instance of xonsh.

When xonsh becomes a core shell it's needed to keep python environment with xonsh stable, predictable and independent of any changes in the system.

The `mamba-install-xonsh.sh` script implements this by creating python environment for xonsh using mamba. It's isolated xonsh-specific environment that can't be affected by upgrading the system packages, python version and other experiments around environments. The xonsh shell will work as well as installing and updating the packages using `xpip` and `xmamba`.

## Install xonsh

Choose the `TARGET_DIR` and run installation:

```xsh
TARGET_DIR=$HOME/.local/xonsh-env PYTHON_VER=3.12 /bin/bash \
  -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anki-code/xonsh-install/main/mamba-install-xonsh.sh)"
# Restart session
```
Now you have:
```
which xonsh
# /home/user/.local/xonsh-env/xbin/xonsh  # You can run this directly from any place.
xonsh

which xpip
# /home/user/.local/xonsh-env/bin/python -m pip
which xmamba
# /home/user/.local/xonsh-env/xbin/xmamba
```
Now you can forget about the cases where manipulations around python and packages break the shell unintended.
