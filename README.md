## Motivation

Xonsh is a Python-based shell, and to run xonsh you must have Python installed. The Python version and its packages can be installed and located anywhere and when you execute `import` or any other Python code during a xonsh session, it will be executed in the Python environment that was used to run the current instance of xonsh. You must have good knowledge of this process after reading [xonsh-cheatsheet](https://github.com/anki-code/xonsh-cheatsheet/).

When xonsh becomes a core shell it's needed to keep python environment with xonsh stable, predictable and independent of any changes in the system.

## mamba-install-xonsh

The `mamba-install-xonsh.sh` script creates independent python environment for xonsh using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/). It's isolated xonsh-specific environment that can't be affected by upgrading the system packages, python version and other experiments around environments. You can use `xpip` and `xmamba` to install packages into this environment intentionally.

Choose the `TARGET_DIR` and run installation:

```xsh
TARGET_DIR=$HOME/.local/xonsh-env PYTHON_VER=3.12 /bin/bash \
  -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anki-code/xonsh-install/main/mamba-install-xonsh.sh)"
# Follow instructions
# Restart session
```

Now you have:
```xsh
which xonsh
# /Users/user/.local/xonsh-env/xbin/xonsh  # You can run this directly from any place.

xonsh
which xpip
# /Users/user/.local/xonsh-env/bin/python -m pip
which xmamba
# /Users/user/.local/xonsh-env/xbin/xmamba
ls -la @$(which xbin-xonsh)  # To run xonsh from xbin if xonsh overwritten by $PATH
# /Users/pc/.local/xonsh-env/xbin/xbin-xonsh -> xbin/xonsh
```

Now forget about the cases where manipulations around python and packages break the shell unintended.

If you have no plans to use `xmamba` [clean](https://fig.io/manual/mamba/clean) the disk space:
```xsh
xmamba clean -a
```
