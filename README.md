## Motivation

Xonsh is a Python-based shell, and to run xonsh you must have Python installed. The Python version and its packages can be installed and located anywhere and when you execute `import` or any other Python code during a xonsh session, it will be executed in the Python environment that was used to run the current instance of xonsh. You must have good knowledge of this process after reading [xonsh-cheatsheet](https://github.com/anki-code/xonsh-cheatsheet/).

When xonsh becomes a core shell it's needed to keep python environment with xonsh stable, predictable and independent of any changes in the system.

## mamba-install-xonsh

The `mamba-install-xonsh.sh` script creates independent python environment for xonsh using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/). It's isolated xonsh-specific environment that can't be affected by upgrading the system packages, python version and other experiments around environments. You can use `xpip` and `xmamba` to install packages into this environment intentionally.

Choose the `TARGET_DIR` and run installation xonsh from the main branch:

```xsh
TARGET_DIR=$HOME/.local/xonsh-env PYTHON_VER=3.11 XONSH_VER='git+https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh#egg=xonsh[full]' \
 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anki-code/xonsh-install/main/mamba-install-xonsh.sh)"
```
You can reset `XONSH_VER='xonsh[full]'` to install latest release.

## Usage

After installation and running xonsh from xonsh-env:
* `xonsh` referf to `~/.local/xonsh-env/xbin/xonsh`.
* `xmamba` refers to `~/.local/xonsh-env/xbin/xmamba`.
* `xpip` refers to `~/.local/xonsh-env/bin/python -m pip`.

Now forget about the cases where manipulations around python and packages break the shell unintended. Use `pip`, `brew` and other package managers without corrupting xonsh-env.

## Additions

* `xbin-xonsh` is to run xonsh from xonsh-env if xonsh overwritten by `$PATH`.
* `xbin-python` is to run python from xonsh-env.
* Use executable script from xonsh-env:
  * `xbin-list-bin` is to list internal `bin` directory in xonsh-env. E.g. you `xpip install lolcat`.
  * `xbin-add` is to add executer from `bin` to `xbin`. E.g. `xbin-add lolcat`.
  * `xbin-list` is to list `xbin` directory. E.g. you check that `lolcat` is there.
  * `xbin-del` is to delete executer from `xbin`. E.g. remove `lolcat` from `xbin`.

## Tips and tricks

If you have no plans to use `xmamba` [clean](https://fig.io/manual/mamba/clean) the disk space: `xmamba clean -a`.
